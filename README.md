# Distortion-Flanger-VST-
Using the JUCE framework for audio plugins, I composed of my own VST to assist in making unique sounds in 
my side hobby of music production. This VST is suppose to modify the particular sound, emulating Jimi Hendrix's
interpretation of The Star Spangled Banner (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgyGJl_xm6o). This VST in still in 
development as I am testing out different audio processing methods of achieving my ideal sound.
